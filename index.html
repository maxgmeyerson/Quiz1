				<p><span class="italics">Pinnacle Entertainment Group</span> and <span class="italics">Visionary Comics</span> have announced a transmedia partnership that will bring <span class="italics">Pinnacle's</span> <span class="bold">Deadlands</span> tabletop roleplaying game setting to comics and prose novels.</p>
				<img id="promotional" alt="Jolie Picture" src="Images/promotional.png">
				<p><span class="italics">Dead Man's Hands</span>, the first release out of this partnership, will be a trade paperback of <span class="italics">Deadlands</span> one shots previously published by <span class="italics">Image Comics</span> and <span class="italics">Visionary Comics</span> and featuring the work of <span class="bold">David Gallaher, Steve Ellis, Jimmy Palmiotti, Justin Gray, Lee Moder, Ron Marz, Bart Sears, Jeff Mariotte, Brook Turner,</span> and <span class="bold">Michael Atiyeh</span>. <span class="italics">Dead Man's Hands</span> will be published in conjunction with <span class="italics">IDW Publishing</span> in March of 2015.</p>
				<p><span class="italics">Visionary Comics</span> will also be working with <span class="italics">Tor Books</span> to publish <span class="italics">Deadlands</span>'-related prose fiction from New York Times bestselling authors <span class="bold">Jonathan Maberry, Seanan McGuire,</span> and <span class="bold">Jeff Mariotte</span>. There are, as yet, no release dates for these novels.</p>
